# BMI-and-Body-Fat-Calculator
This project was made using the coding software from Java. This program is an interactive program where the program pops up on an interactive panel where the user enters their height, weight, waist, and neck measurements to see if their BMI is normal. It also provides comments on the information that you have inputed in.
